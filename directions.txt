#to do#
- read both links, first for official stuff, second one for program flow/inspiration
- https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf
- https://gitlab.com/madebypixel02/minishell
- before or in the parser make words like ls -l into a command by giving the fullpath (use findpath functions)
same as above^, find a place to fill in the new exec struct.
- look at Mind Map img's in gitlab link and setup something like that before parisng,
makes excecution much easyer as we can re-use quite some from pipex logic.
- been told that our struct isn't great and we should add a cmd struct that expends he "text" nodes
- 

- pipex is changed in 4 different ways, try to make 1 that still used pathfinding.
- change pipex/pipex related stuff where it accepts the new token system

- make a bunch of error handling when inpropper stuff is parsed
- when multiple infiles or outfiles are given only use the first and last # ----- # wrong
- handle the stuff before parsing to pipex, when theres only 1 cmd, multiple in/outfile etc
- at the end change this shit #include "../include/minishell.h" 
- exit/export/unset/cd with no options

- fix path-based commands (absolute path)
- add function that cleans up input (like pipe_parsing used to-) OR change pipex that it does stuff based on the tokens passed.
- remove shell struct again (maybe?) (I think shell struct is fine?)
- orhan bothered me and I forgot what I was putting here

- maybe ? change input ** in shell struct to hold an actual array of pointers instead of just being a pointer to a pointer so index can be used? (not really needed)

#rowan#
- clean up new code (norm)
- keep asking nils on what to do
- help with pipex/pipex related stuff changes
- once stuff works, bother people about what we're missing

#nils#
- go to top of new todo list and focus fully on that, execution comes later

- change pipex/pipex related stuff where it accepts the new token system
- make the thing actually work in the current and inbetween states
