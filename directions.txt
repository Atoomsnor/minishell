#to do#
- add all the linkedlist stuff to libft? takes so much space
- make error/exit codes propper "wheyy"
- fix < infile > out NEEDS TO NOT COPY SHIT
- ls | 
- re-enable heredocing

fix these:
cat <out.txt >1 <out2.txt >2 <out3.txt >4

- fix norm errors which are all >5functions, linetoolong and >25lines
- ask others for stuff that will break our program


- orhan bothered me and I forgot what I was putting here
#rowan#
- still fix header 

#nils#
- fix excecution part a bit
- mald about rowan's dyslexia
- be bored before raid and start on environment stuff


norm changes,

// made i++ in new_env =, instead of under line 38
char	**exporting(char *str, char **env)

// print_srings_fd doesnt excist?
int	blast_error(t_error error, t_exec *exec)
print_strings_fd(2, exec->full_cmd[0], ": ", "command not found\n", NULL);

// removed from bottom of lynch exec, exec should alrdy be NULL at that pnt
	if (exec)
		free(exec);

// split handle_wildcard into set_var_name, not tested so glhf
// (can prob make it look nicer)

//removed ft_free and makes it use free_array in string_split.c, 
// free_array is in utils.c, shove more stuff to there but theyre stattic?
