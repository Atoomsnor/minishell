#to do#
- change pipex/pipex related stuff where it accepts the new token system

- make a bunch of error handling when inpropper stuff is parsed
- when multiple infiles or outfiles are given only use the first and last 
- handle the stuff before parsing to pipex, when theres only 1 cmd, multiple in/outfile etc
- at the end change this shit #include "../include/minishell.h" 
- exit/export/unset/cd with no options

- fix path-based commands (absolute path)
- add function that cleans up input (like pipe_parsing used to-) OR change pipex that it does stuff based on the tokens passed.
- remove shell struct again (maybe?) (I think shell struct is fine?)
- orhan bothered me and I forgot what I was putting here


#rowan#
- clean up new code (norm)
- keep asking nils on what to do
- help with pipex/pipex related stuff changes
- once stuff works, bother people about what we're missing

#nils#
- change pipex/pipex related stuff where it accepts the new token system
- make the thing actually work in the current and inbetween states
