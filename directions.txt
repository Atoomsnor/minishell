fix these:

- return proper value																				// DONE ?
- Tabs are treated as regular characters															
- `echo -nnn` and `echo -n -n` behave differently than in bash										// partially done
- `exit 1 2` isnt supposed to exit
- `exit 10000000000000000000000000000000000000` isnt handled correctly
- running `cat` and then pressing ctrl+c has a different exit code than bash						
- `echo "'$USER'"` segfaults																		// partial fix?
- `../../usr/bin/ls` in home directory causes double free											// unable to replicate ?
- `ls >` should be a syntax error																	
- heredoc should never expand variables when delimiter contains quotes								
- `cat <<eo'f'` should end with eof, also shouldnt expand because the delimiter contains quotes		// heredoc strtrim -> quotetrim?
